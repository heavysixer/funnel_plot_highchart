h4. When To Use A Funnel Plot

A funnel plot is best used when the goal of the visualization is to detect bias of a particular result using related data that measure the same event. Funnel plots are often used as a tool of meta-analysis used to compare the results of smaller dataset to the larger datasets to find intervention effect.

h4. About Funnel Plots

bq. "Funnel plots are a visual tool for investigating publication and other bias in meta-analysis. They are simple scatterplots of the treatment effects estimated from individual studies (horizontal axis) against a measure of study size (vertical axis). The name “funnel plot” is based on the precision in the estima- tion of the underlying treatment effect increasing as the sample size of component studies increases. Therefore, in the absence of bias, results from small studies will scatter widely at the bottom of the graph, with the spread narrowing among larger studies. Publication bias (the association of publication probability with the statistical significance of study results) may lead to asymmetrical funnel plots. It is, however, important to realize that publication bias is only one of a number of possible causes of funnel-plot asymmetry—funnel plots should be seen as a generic means of examining small study effects (the tendency for the smaller studies in a meta-analysis to show larger treatment effects) rather than a tool to diagnose specific types of bias. This article introduces the metafunnel command, which produces funnel plots in Stata. In accordance with published recommendations, standard error is used as the measure of study size. Treatment effects expressed as ratio measures (for example risk ratios or odds ratios) may be plotted on a log scale."

h4. Problems with Funnel Plots

"Some authors have argued that visual interpretation of funnel plots is too subjective to be useful. In particular, Terrin et al. found that researchers had only a limited ability to correctly identify funnel plots from meta-analyses subject to publication bias (Terrin 2005)."

"A further, important, problem with funnel plots is that some effect estimates (e.g. odds ratios and standardized mean differences) are naturally correlated with their standard errors, and can produce spurious asymmetry in a funnel plot. We discuss this problem in more detail in Section 10.4.3."
